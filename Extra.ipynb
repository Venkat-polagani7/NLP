The weather patterns are changing in these high-altitude regions where it is becoming more conducive to grow coffee and the local flora and fauna are suffering because of the global climate change. So, it is becoming conducive for coffee. The traditional areas are becoming non-conducive and the non-traditional areas are becoming slowly conducive,” Suhas explains the growing popularity of coffee cultivation in Nagaland.\n",
        "At 6,500 feet above sea level, Suhas steers through the foothills of the Himalayas to the Nagaland capital from Dimapur to investigate the bubbling uprising of a coffee wave in the state. While on the road, the all-new Hyundai TUCSON prioritises user safety with features like the High Beam Assist that is designed to automatically dim high beams when it senses a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.\"\"\",\"\"\" The coffee district of Coorg is credited with producing almost 35 percent of the total coffee production in the country, earning it the nickname ‘Coffee Cup of India’. Characteristic of the much-loved Coorgi robustas is a bold and striking flavour profile with spicy undertones, a go-to for enhancing the flavour of milder blends. Its vibrant flavour is owing to the traditional cultivation methods that farmers of the land have stayed true to for centuries. “Open sunroof,” Suhas instructs and on command, the state-of-art smart tech responds by unfurling views of the sprawling sky and blue rolling hills through the panoramic sunroof that eliminates boundaries between him and the luxuriant Shola jungles. Suhas navigates his way to the Rainforest Retreat nestled in the Mojo Plantation, 10 kilometres shy of Madikeri, to uncover tales of the quintessential Coorgi robustas that is an instant cure for morning blues.\"\"\",\"\"\" nlike Karnataka farms where coffee is the core plantation, here, it is multi-cropped on spice-growing farms, across Kerala. This makes the coffee bolder and spicier, rich with undertones of clove, cinnamon, black pepper, white pepper, cardamom and other aromatics. Added to the unique flavour profile is the unmatched silkiness of the brewed baubles that cascades like warm liquid gold to the pure joy of every coffee lover.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\",\"\"\" In the lofty hills of Chikkamagaluru—the birthplace of coffee cultivation in India—misty hilltops, mild drizzle and chilly winds provide an inviting landscape for driving explorations in search of the beverage. India’s leading coffee connoisseur Suhas Dwarakanath, powered by the premium and dynamic all-new Hyundai TUCSON, makes his way to Karnataka to unravel coffee stories from India. \n",

        "Traversing rugged terrains and challenging paths, his 800-kilometre circuit takes him to five estates—Ratnagiri, Salawara, Hulikere, Hali Berry and Blue Mountain—to experience the bean-to-cup journey of the beverage. As a roaster himself, Suhas shares insights and anecdotes as he moved from sessions on cherry-picking on the plantations to the hulling and roasting facilities. Follow his drive through the luscious landscape and tap into the world of coffee cultivation that drew Suhas in for an aromatic journey. \"\"\"]\n",

It’s been nearly a year since COVID-19 upended our world—work-from-home, travel bans, lives and livelihoods lost.

Even as lockdowns lifted and restaurants started reopening, it’s hardly been business as usual. Fewer tables, packaged cutlery, and more hygiene products have become a norm.\n",

Of course, rules keep changing as the virus surges on, and despite the good news on the vaccine front, it is likely that we will be social distancing at least until 2022 as Harvard scientists had predicted last year.\n",

I have had several memorable restaurant meals over the years. Here are just eight of them, those that I look forward to revisiting when the world is back to “normal.” Or at least to a new normal. \"\"\"]).toarray(),vect.transform([\"\"\"The three mothers were asked for contacts of 10 friends from their childhood, and the trio thus visited 30 more people to eat, talk, document and learn. “For the aunties we visited, we would always be children and they were happy to share their food and recipes, which we would not have gotten without the references we had.” These contacts provided additional references, which led Regi, John and Augustine to visit 265 homes over three years.\n",

The trio explored versions and dug deep into what made a difference in each preparation of the same dish. “We were told that except for staples like salt and sugar almost everything was home grown or locally available. Fresh whole spices would be sourced locally, washed, dried and powdered. This made a huge difference to the food.”\n",

Similarly, we found the duck from Thanneermukkom near Alleppey and Kumarakom to be flavourful.” For Kappa Chakka Kandhari, such informal, but research and experience-based geographical mapping has set the blueprint for sourcing ingredients.\"\"\"]).toarray())\n",
